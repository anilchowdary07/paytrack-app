# 📱 Android APK Deployment Guide for PayTrack

## ❌ **Current Status:**
Android toolchain is missing. We need to set up Android development tools.

## 🛠 **Setup Options:**

### **Option 1: Quick APK Build (Using existing Android folder)**
Your project already has Android configuration files. Let's try building directly:

### **Option 2: Install Android Studio (Recommended)**
1. **Download Android Studio:**
   - Visit: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Download for macOS
   - Install and run first-time setup

2. **Install SDK Command Line Tools:**
   - Open Android Studio
   - Go to `Preferences` → `Appearance & Behavior` → `System Settings` → `Android SDK`
   - Check `Android SDK Command-line Tools`
   - Click `Apply` and `OK`

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   echo 'export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk' >> ~/.zshrc
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

### **Option 3: Command Line Tools Only**
```bash
# Download command line tools
mkdir -p ~/Android/sdk
cd ~/Android/sdk
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/commandlinetools-mac-9477386_latest.zip
unzip commandlinetools-mac-9477386_latest.zip
mkdir cmdline-tools/latest
mv cmdline-tools/* cmdline-tools/latest/
```

## 🚀 **Quick Build Attempt**
Let's try building with existing setup first.

## 📋 **Build Commands:**
```bash
# Clean project
flutter clean

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build APK (debug)
flutter build apk

# Build APK (release)
flutter build apk --release

# Build App Bundle (for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release
```

## 🔑 **App Signing (for Release)**
For production APK, you'll need to:
1. Generate a keystore
2. Configure signing in android/app/build.gradle
3. Build signed APK

## 📱 **Alternative: Use GitHub Actions**
Build APK in the cloud without local Android setup.
